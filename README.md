# Rails Assessment

It's time to put our Rails know-how to the test.

## Objectives
+ MVC
+ REST
+ Request/Response Cycle
+ Form/Form Helpers
+ ActiveRecord
+ Validations
+ Stay calm, focus and code

## Setup

Before you begin, fork and clone this repo, run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed` to get started.

## The Domain

We've been building an application where we can see all of the sweets that vendors are selling. The basic skeleton has been started for you already, but we'd love to have your help with finishing it. Here at Flatiron School, we tend to consume lots of sweets. WE-LOVE-SWEETS.

**Vendors can sell many different sweets and sweets can be sold by many different vendors.** This means we need to create a model that let's us join the two together. For sake of simplicity, we'd like the model to be called `VendorSweet`. It will connect **a single sweet** and **a single vendor** together. Make sure to put the appropriate attributes on this model.

## Instructions / Deliverables

***To help complete this task we listed out the required steps below. Look through them carefully to get a sense of the requirements of this code challenge, then tackle them one by one.***

1. Start with creating the `VendorSweet` model. It should have an attribute for the price at which the sweet will be sold by the vendor (use an integer data type for this column: we'll treat the numbers in it as the price, in cents). We'll need to make sure to also have the appropriate migration to our schema for this to work. It is always suggested to test that our migration worked, so go into the console and try to create your first `VendorSweet` with a given `Sweet`, `Vendor`, and price.


2. A user should be able to visit a page with a form that will let them choose a `Vendor` and a `Sweet` and create a `VendorSweet` when they submit that form. The form should include a dropdown to select a vendor, another dropdown to select its sweet, and an input for the price. We'd like the route to this form to follow the RESTful convention (as well as the route that it should submit its form values to). Once the `VendorSweet` is created, we'd like to go to the selected vendor's show page.

3. Let's add some validations. `VendorSweets` should *not* be able to be saved if:
  a) the price is blank
  b) the price is a negative number
  c) the price is a number that isn't an integer (like 99.5) 
We should still go to the selected vendor's show page _if the `VendorSweet` is valid_, but if the `VendorSweet` is *not* valid, we should see the form, with the values the user entered. On that page, we should also list of validation messages about what went wrong. To help you test the validations, think about some prices your users could input that _would_ and _wouldn't_ be valid. Try them out.

4. The vendor's show page should include the vendor's name (ie. Insomnia Cookies) and a list of the sweets that they sell.

5. On the vendor's index page, we should see a list of vendor's names (we've already done this part for you). When a user clicks on a vendor's name, it should take a user to the vendor's show page.

6. On the sweet's index page, we should see a list of sweet's names (we've already done this part for you). When a user clicks on a sweet's name, it should take a user to the sweet's show page.

7. The sweet's show page should include the sweet's name.

### Hints / Tips

+ Remember we want to be RESTful. What URL should show info about a particular vendor? What URL should create the vendor_sweet association? What controller actions are associated?

+ When creating the vendor_sweet association think about the various ways [Rails allows us to define associations between models](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html))
+ Read through this documentation if your having a bit of trouble figuring out how to make the [dropdown](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#making-select-boxes-with-ease)

+ Also remember that [Validations are very important](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html)


### Stretch 

8. Make each vendor in the list of vendors on the sweet page link to its respective vendor

9. Make each sweet in the list of sweets on the vendor page link to its respective sweet

10. Create a validation that prevents a `VendorSweet` from being saved if one already exists for that `Vendor` and `Sweet`. Make sure the message shown to your users makes enough sense for them to fix the error.
