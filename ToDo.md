Build an application where we can see all of the sweets that vendors are selling

Vendors can sell `many` different sweets and sweets can be sold by `many` different vendors.** This means we need to create a model that let's us join the two together. For sake of simplicity, we'd like the model to be called `VendorSweet`. It will connect **a single sweet** and **a single vendor** together. Make sure to put the appropriate attributes on this model.

MANY TO MANY Relationship
Vendor --<VendorSweet>-- Sweet
